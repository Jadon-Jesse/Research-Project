F.A.Q.
======
Q: "Why does frank west seem to have almost infinite combos?"
A: "What he's capable of increases as he levels up, so he becomes a better character
over time. Thus his combos have more ways to be extended with it. However he has 0 infinites
whatsoever on standard sized characters."

Q: "Why is his AI so overpowered/cheap/broken"
A: "I don't think those words mean what you think they do. He's probably one of the most
balanced characters I've ever worked on...at level 1. If you let him level up yes he does certainly get better but even his enhanced abilities come with very big costs. If you pay attention to how he attacks hes really not that hard to take down even at the hardest
AI settings."

Q: "How can I level up?"
A: "Usually I'd say watch what the AI does but if I had to write it. All you have to do is 
use the camera when the opponent is in a downed state after a combo of your choosing. it will
increase his level based on how many hits were done. The enemy can be in any hitstate for 
this rule to apply so they don't even have to be downed."

Combo notes
===========

Frank's strengths lie in his ability to chain moves into each
other. Here are his basic combo rules:

1.  You can combo from weaker basic attacks into stronger ones
    eg. light kick -> medium kick

2.  You can combo into special attacks from most basic attacks
    eg. stand heavy punch -> Tools of Survival

3.  You can combo into hyper attacks from all basic and special
    attacks
    eg. Tools of Survival -> Real Megabuster

4.  You can only use certain moves so many times before p2 drops out of 
    the combo so avoid the same inputs in a string. 

5. You can combo F+MP into HP when Frank is lvl 4

These rules make it possible for you to do some damaging combos.
Experiment, and perfect your own Combos!
