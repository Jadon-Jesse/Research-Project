 Character template by aperson98 version 1.0
This a template I made that isn't really based on any one game just a general base character anyway enjoy.


Moves-
Projectile- D,DF,F X,Y, or A
Hyper Move- F,D,DF X+Y (uses 1 super bar)


-Credits-
Jmorphman - for the Ken sprites though the colors were reduced to just 6 colors to encourage putting in new graphics and colors your own character.
Acey- for some small bits of coding I took from EOH (super jump and damage scaling) Don't worry KFM is the base character to make err this base character.
