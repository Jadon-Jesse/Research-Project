;-| Button Remapping |-----------------------------------------------------
; This section lets you remap the player's buttons (to easily change the
; button configuration). The format is:
;   old_button = new_button
; If new_button is left blank, the button cannot be pressed.

; 2. State entry
; --------------
; This is where you define what commands bring you to what states.
;
; Each state entry block looks like:
;   [State -1, Label]           ;Change Label to any name you want to use to
;                               ;identify the state with.
;   type = ChangeState          ;Don't change this
;   value = new_state_number
;   trigger1 = command = command_name
;   . . .  (any additional triggers)
;
; - new_state_number is the number of the state to change to
; - command_name is the name of the command (from the section above)
; - Useful triggers to know:
;   - statetype
;       S, C or A : current state-type of player (stand, crouch, air)
;   - ctrl
;       0 or 1 : 1 if player has control. Unless "interrupting" another
;                move, you'll want ctrl = 1
;   - stateno
;       number of state player is in - useful for "move interrupts"
;   - movecontact
;       0 or 1 : 1 if player's last attack touched the opponent
;                useful for "move interrupts"
;
; Note: The order of state entry is important.
;   State entry with a certain command must come before another state
;   entry with a command that is the subset of the first.
;   For example, command "fwd_a" must be listed before "a", and
;   "fwd_ab" should come before both of the others.
;
; For reference on triggers, see CNS documentation.
;
; Just for your information (skip if you're not interested):
; This part is an extension of the CNS. "State -1" is a special state
; that is executed once every game-tick, regardless of what other state
; you are in.


; Don't remove the following line. It's required by the CMD standard.
