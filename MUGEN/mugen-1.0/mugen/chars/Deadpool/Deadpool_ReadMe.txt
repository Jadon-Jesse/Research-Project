Avengers vs. X-Men
==============
Year ago The Phoenix became one with the powerful telepathic mutant, Jean Grey. Once thought dead and gone, the Phoenix Force is now racing through the galaxy, headed straight for earth. Speculation suggests that the Phoenix is coming in order to possess the newest young mutant hero, Hope Summers. The X-Men believe that the Phoenix brings a rebirth that will usher in a utopia for mutant kind while the Avengers believe the Phoenix will destroy the earth, as it has destroyed every other planet in its pathway.

The two super hero powerhouses collide over the fate of the world in Marvel’s storyline, Avenger’s vs. X-Men.

Game Play
==============
Canceling – is the ability to stop one attack by performing the commands to start a second attack. Typically this is used to cancel a normal attack with a special attack or to cancel a special attack with a hyper attack.

Combos – The combo style within the game fall into three categories, called MH, Magic Series and Aerial Rave.

LMH: Characters with these properties can perform combos such as the following while standing or crouching:

o	LP, MP, HP
o	LK, MK, HK

Magic Series: Characters with these properties can perform all of the LMH combos as well as the following:
o	LP, LK, MP, MK, HP

Aerial Rave: All characters can perform an aerial rave using the following buttons:

o	LP, LK, MP, MK, HP

Ground Bounce – occurs when your opponent is hit to the ground then they bounce into the air allowing for any attack to make contact with the opponent a second time. A Ground Bounce attack can typically one be used once per combo.

Launching – is the ability to hit your opponent into the air. The opponent will remain in a vulnerable state until they reach the height of the launch, then if they are not hit again while in the air they will recover before descending.

OTG (Off the Ground) – are certain attacks that will connect with the opponent even while they are lying on the ground. Typically such opponent cannot be hit until they stand up again, except when an OTG attack is used against them.

Wall Bounce – are attacks that send the stunned opponent flying into the opposite side of the screen where they will then bounce off back towards your character allowing for an additional combo attack. A Wall Bounce typically cannot be performed against a cornered opponent.
